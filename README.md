# ixxx

"i" in English mean self, but in Chinese, it represents 'love'. 'Love' is eternal, and 'love' is the direction of one's heart.

'x' in English mean 'Twitter',but in Chinese,it represents 'who' .

so , 'i x x x' in Chinese mean 'Who cares', abbreviated as 'fuck'

## use this command

defined two command , one is `remove` ，other is `update`

### remove

you can use `npx ixxx  rm  <filename>  <filename>  <...> ` to remove file or directory, and not worry "My Windows commands don't work on Mac OS " 、"I removed the folder on Windows and there were no errors in the file." (Not good, I put in a lot of effort to solve these two problems and added this small feature. I hope you like it.)

```sh
npx ixxx rm <file name>
```

_If you don't want to display the log information of this process, you can use `-i` to ignore it_

```sh
npx ixxx rm  -i <file name>
```

### update

npm Every time a package upgrade occurs, it requires inputting a lot of commands and also considering the computer environment. I collapsed。。。。

```sh
npx ixxx up
```

_Try to ensure that your features are complete and the git directory is clean before upgrading_

If you don't want to display the log information of this process, you can use `-i` to ignore it

```sh
npx ixxx up  -i
```
